        <h1>Introduction to Baseball</h1>
        <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game that is widely popular in countries like the United States, Japan, and South Korea. It involves two teams alternating between batting and fielding, aiming to score runs by hitting the ball and running around four bases arranged in a diamond shape.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>The game is played on a field with four bases laid out in a square diamond. One team bats while the other fields. The batting team scores runs by hitting the ball thrown by the pitcher and running the bases. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters out through catches, throws, or strikeouts.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pitcher:</strong> Throws the ball to the batter, aiming to get them out.</li>
            <li><strong>Catcher:</strong> Receives pitches and guards home plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Infielders:</strong> Cover the bases and the area around them.</li>
            <li><strong>Outfielders:</strong> Catch or field balls hit into the outfield.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Baseball</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each team gets nine innings to bat and field.</li>
            <li>A run is scored when a player successfully touches all four bases.</li>
            <li>A batter is out after three strikes or if a fielder catches the ball before it hits the ground.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Teams adopt various styles such as power hitting, small ball (focusing on singles and stolen bases), or strong defensive plays. Style often depends on the team's roster and strengths.</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using pitchers with varying speeds and pitches to confuse batters.</li>
            <li>Executing double plays to quickly get two outs.</li>
            <li>Stealing bases to gain an advantage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Victory in baseball requires a combination of strong batting, precise pitching, and efficient fielding. Teams must outscore their opponents while preventing runs with solid defense.</p>
