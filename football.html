        <h1>Introduction to Football</h1>
        <p>Football, often referred to as soccer in some regions, is the world's most popular sport, with billions of fans worldwide. It is a team sport played professionally in leagues, tournaments, and internationally. From grassroots games in parks to grand stadiums hosting matches, football transcends cultures and brings people together.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>Football is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponentâ€™s net while defending your own. Players must use their feet, heads, or other parts of their body to control and move the ball, except for goalkeepers who can use their hands within the penalty area.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Protects the goal and organizes the defense.</li>
            <li><strong>Defenders:</strong> Block attacks from the opposition and clear the ball.</li>
            <li><strong>Midfielders:</strong> Support both defense and attack by controlling the flow of the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Forwards/Strikers:</strong> Create and capitalize on scoring opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Football</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The offside rule prevents attackers from gaining an unfair advantage.</li>
            <li>Fouls result in free kicks, penalties, or yellow/red cards depending on severity.</li>
            <li>The ball must completely cross the goal line to count as a goal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Teams adopt various styles such as possession play, counter-attacking, or a high-press strategy to dominate opponents. Style choice often reflects the team's strengths and coaching philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining defensive solidity while attacking effectively.</li>
            <li>Exploiting space behind the defense using fast players.</li>
            <li>Dominating possession to tire opponents and create scoring chances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Victory in football requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. Teams must convert scoring opportunities while minimizing errors in defense. Mental resilience, effective substitutions, and tactical flexibility are often decisive.</p>
