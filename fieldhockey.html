        <h1>Introduction to Field Hockey</h1>
        <p>Field hockey is a fast-paced team sport played on a grass or artificial turf field. Teams use sticks to hit a small, hard ball into the opposing team's goal to score points. It is a widely popular sport, particularly in countries like India, Australia, and the Netherlands.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>The game is played between two teams of 11 players each, including a goalkeeper. Players use a hooked stick to control, pass, and shoot the ball. The objective is to outscore the opposing team within the designated match time.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> Defends the goal and prevents the ball from entering.</li>
            <li><strong>Defenders:</strong> Protect their side of the field and disrupt opposition attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Midfielders:</strong> Act as a bridge between defense and attack, controlling the flow of the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Forwards:</strong> Focus on scoring goals and creating offensive opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Field Hockey</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players can only use the flat side of the stick to play the ball.</li>
            <li>No player, except the goalkeeper, can intentionally use their body to control the ball.</li>
            <li>Penalty corners and strokes are awarded for certain fouls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Teams employ various tactics, such as pressing high, playing defensively, or using speed to counterattack. The choice of style often depends on the strengths of the players and the strategy of the coach.</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Winning strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining possession and controlling the pace of the game.</li>
            <li>Quick transitions from defense to attack to exploit gaps.</li>
            <li>Effective penalty corner execution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Success in field hockey requires strong teamwork, precise stick skills, and strategic thinking. Players must capitalize on scoring opportunities while maintaining a solid defense to secure victory.</p>
