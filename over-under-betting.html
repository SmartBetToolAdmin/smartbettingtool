        <p>Over/under betting allows you to predict the total number of goals in a match. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze average goals scored and conceded by both teams.</li>
            <li>Consider games in high-scoring leagues for over 2.5 goals bets.</li>
            <li>Look for defensive teams in low-scoring leagues for under 2.5 goals bets.</li>
            <li>Factor in match importance; critical matches often have fewer goals.</li>
        </ul>
