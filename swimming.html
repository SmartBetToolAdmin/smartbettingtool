        <h1>Introduction to Swimming</h1>
        <p>Swimming is an individual or team water sport where players use their limbs to move through water. It is a globally popular activity, played both recreationally and competitively in pools or open waters.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>Swimming involves various strokes, including freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly, each requiring specific techniques. Competitors aim to complete a set distance in the shortest time, often racing in lanes within a swimming pool.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Swimmer</h2>
        <p>As an individual sport, the swimmer is responsible for their performance. In relay races, each team member swims a portion of the distance, coordinating transitions seamlessly for optimal results.</p>

        <h2>Rules of Swimming</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swimmers must start within their designated lanes.</li>
            <li>Specific techniques must be used for each stroke (e.g., breaststroke requires simultaneous arm and leg movements).</li>
            <li>Turns and finishes must adhere to stroke-specific rules (e.g., touching the wall with both hands in breaststroke).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Swimming events can vary by distance, stroke type, and relay format. Common styles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freestyle:</strong> Emphasizes speed and efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Backstroke:</strong> Requires swimming on the back with continuous arm and leg motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Breaststroke:</strong> Focuses on synchronized arm and leg movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Butterfly:</strong> A demanding stroke requiring simultaneous arm pulls and dolphin kicks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective swimming strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining consistent breathing and rhythm.</li>
            <li>Optimizing stroke efficiency to conserve energy.</li>
            <li>Using powerful starts and turns to gain an edge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Winning in swimming demands peak physical fitness, precise technique, and mental resilience. Athletes must execute their strokes flawlessly, optimize speed and endurance, and strategically pace their races to outlast competitors.</p>
