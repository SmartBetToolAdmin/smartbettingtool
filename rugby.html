        <h1>Introduction to Rugby</h1>
        <p>Rugby is a dynamic and physical team sport that originated in England. Played with an oval ball, it involves two teams striving to score points by carrying, passing, or kicking the ball to the opposing team's goal area. Rugby is celebrated for its intensity, strategy, and camaraderie among players.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>Rugby is played on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The objective is to score points through tries, conversions, penalty kicks, or drop goals. Players can carry the ball forward, pass it laterally or backward, and use tactical kicks to gain territory. The game is characterized by its tackling, scrums, and lineouts.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forwards:</strong> Responsible for winning possession and providing strength in scrums and lineouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Backs:</strong> Use speed and skill to execute plays and score points.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum-half:</strong> Links the forwards and backs, distributing the ball effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Fly-half:</strong> Strategically directs the team's attack through kicks and passes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Rugby</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ball must not be passed forward.</li>
            <li>Tackling must be below the shoulders to ensure safety.</li>
            <li>Players must remain onside during play to avoid penalties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Rugby teams employ various styles such as a forward-dominated approach, expansive play utilizing the backs, or a balanced strategy blending both. The style often reflects team strengths and coaching philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining possession and controlling the pace of the game.</li>
            <li>Exploiting gaps in the opponent's defense.</li>
            <li>Executing set plays effectively during scrums and lineouts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <p>Victory in rugby requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. Teams must capitalize on scoring opportunities, maintain a solid defense, and adapt to dynamic game situations. Mental toughness and disciplined play are crucial for success.</p>
