        <h1>Introduction to Volleyball</h1>
        <p>Volleyball is a dynamic and fast-paced team sport enjoyed by millions worldwide. Played on a rectangular court divided by a net, volleyball emphasizes agility, teamwork, and precise coordination. It is popular both indoors and on beaches.</p>

        <h2>How the Sport is Played</h2>
        <p>The objective of volleyball is to score points by sending the ball over the net and into the opponent's court, ensuring it touches the ground before they can return it. Teams are allowed up to three touches to return the ball.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Functions of Each Player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setter:</strong> Sets up attacks by delivering accurate passes to attackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Outside Hitter:</strong> Primarily responsible for attacking and blocking from the left side.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Blocker:</strong> Defends against attacks and performs quick attacks near the net.</li>
            <li><strong>Libero:</strong> Specializes in defensive skills and cannot attack the ball above the net's height.</li>
            <li><strong>Opposite Hitter:</strong> Versatile player who blocks, serves, and attacks from the back row.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of Volleyball</h2>
        <p>Key rules include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each team consists of six players on the court at any time.</li>
            <li>The ball must not be held or thrown; it must be hit cleanly.</li>
            <li>Players must rotate positions clockwise after winning a serve.</li>
            <li>A match is won by the team that wins the majority of sets (usually best of 5).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Styles</h2>
        <p>Volleyball strategies vary, including fast-paced attacks, strong defensive plays, and tactical serves. Beach volleyball, played with two players per team, emphasizes stamina and adaptability.</p>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>Effective strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong communication between players to anticipate opponents' moves.</li>
            <li>Precise serves to target weak spots in the opposition.</li>
            <li>Quick attacks to exploit gaps in the defense.</li>
        </ul>
