        <p>Both teams to score (BTTS) betting is popular for games with attacking teams. Hereâ€™s how to improve your BTTS strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research teams with strong offensive records but weak defenses.</li>
            <li>Look for matches where both teams consistently score goals.</li>
            <li>Consider league trends, as some leagues have high BTTS percentages.</li>
            <li>Check weather conditions and player injuries, as they can affect scoring.</li>
        </ul>
